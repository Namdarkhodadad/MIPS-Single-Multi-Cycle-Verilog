# MIPS-Single-Multi-Cycle-Verilog
In this repository, I am posting the Implementation of a MIPS processor in a Single(&amp; Multi) Cycle. This code was written by me and my teammate Arsham Lolohari for our Computer Architecture course.

You can see two separate folders, Single Cycle and Multi Cycle, in which there is a main file, their testbench, and some .hex files which are the commands.
